## Create a README.md for your container image

Checkout a new branch (Or, use the current branch you have where you have added your Containerfile)

```bash
git checkout -b [new-branch] upstream/main

# if you already have a branch and/or PR open for adding your Containerfile, you can add this assignment in this branch

```

Head to the directory you created under `assignments/[LASTNAME]` and add a file named `README.md`.
Check out this [Markdown CheatSheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or use some other visually pleasing text formatting syntax.

Create a document in markdown or similar format to describe the following:

1. Describe the script you wrote in the February 22nd assignment.
2. Describe how to build the container image.
3. Describe how to run the image.

Also:

* Head to [the doc where you listed your image](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fKh-2BkDilRNhH_bgAzQsNx1NF8_1TUJPC5M3EFyg8M/edit?usp=sharing)
* Address any comments from the instructors to fix your image, script, or Containerfile.
* Add your README.md and any Containerfile and script updates, then commit your changes.


Commit your changes, push to your remote fork, then open a Pull Request. You may already have a working-branch and an open Pull Request.
If this is the case, you can add the new commit to the current working branch and when you push to your remote the PR will be updated with
your latest changes.
